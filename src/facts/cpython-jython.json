  "detailedDescription": "Python is actually a language specification with multiple implementations. CPython (written in C) is the standard implementation. Jython runs on the Java Virtual Machine, PyPy is written in Python itself and focuses on speed, and IronPython runs on the .NET framework. Each implementation has its own strengths and use cases.",
