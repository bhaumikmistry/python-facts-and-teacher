  "shortDescription": "In Python, everything is an object - even functions and classes!",
  "detailedDescription": "Python follows a consistent object model where everything is an object with a type, identity, and value. This means you can assign functions to variables, pass them as arguments, and even modify classes at runtime. This flexibility is what makes Python so powerful and dynamic.",
  "examples": [
    "# Functions are objects",
    "def greet(): return 'Hello!'",
    "my_func = greet",
    "print(my_func())  # Hello!",
    "",
    "# Even numbers are objects",
    "x = 42",
    "print(x.__class__)  # <class 'int'>",
    "print(dir(x))  # Shows all methods"
