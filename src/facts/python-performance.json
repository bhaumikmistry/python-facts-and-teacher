  "shortDescription": "Python can be surprisingly fast with the right techniques!",
  "detailedDescription": "While Python is interpreted and generally slower than compiled languages, there are many ways to optimize Python code. Using built-in functions, NumPy for numerical operations, and tools like Cython or PyPy can dramatically improve performance. The key is knowing when and how to optimize.",
  "examples": [
    "# Use built-in functions (they're implemented in C)",
    "# Slow:",
    "result = []",
    "for i in range(1000):",
    "    result.append(i * 2)",
    "",
    "# Fast:",
    "result = [i * 2 for i in range(1000)]",
    "",
    "# Even faster:",
    "import numpy as np",
