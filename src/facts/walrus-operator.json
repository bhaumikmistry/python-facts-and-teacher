  "shortDescription": "Python 3.8 introduced the walrus operator (:=) for assignment expressions!",
  "detailedDescription": "The walrus operator (:=) allows assignment within expressions, making code more concise in certain situations. Named for its resemblance to a walrus's eyes and tusks, this operator assigns a value to a variable and returns that value in a single expression.",
  "examples": [
    "# Traditional approach",
    "data = input('Enter a value: ')",
    "if len(data) > 5:",
    "    print(f'Long input: {data}')",
    "",
    "# With walrus operator",
    "if (n := len(input('Enter a value: '))) > 5:",
    "    print(f'Long input with {n} characters')",
    "",
    "# Useful in list comprehensions",
