  "shortDescription": "Try importing braces from __future__ - Python has a humorous response!",
  "detailedDescription": "Python developers occasionally joke about adding curly braces like other languages. The `from __future__ import braces` easter egg is designed to instantly shut down any conversation about introducing curly braces to Python. It throws a SyntaxError with the message 'not a chance', reinforcing Python's commitment to indentation-based syntax.",
  "examples": [
    "# Try this in your Python interpreter:",
    "from __future__ import braces",
    "",
    "# Output:",
    "# SyntaxError: not a chance",
    "",
    "# This is Python's humorous way of saying:",
    "# 'We will NEVER add braces to Python!'",
    "",
    "# Python's philosophy: indentation defines structure",
