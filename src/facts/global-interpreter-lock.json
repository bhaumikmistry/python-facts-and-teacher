  "shortDescription": "Python's GIL allows only one thread to execute Python code at a time!",
  "detailedDescription": "The Global Interpreter Lock is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously. While this can limit multi-threaded performance, it simplifies memory management and makes Python more stable.",
  "examples": [
    "import threading",
    "import time",
    "",

    "    for i in range(1000000):",
    "        pass",
