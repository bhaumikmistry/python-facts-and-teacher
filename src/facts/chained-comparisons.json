  "shortDescription": "Python allows mathematical-style chained comparisons like 1 < x < 10!",
  "detailedDescription": "Unlike most programming languages, Python supports chained comparisons that read like mathematical expressions. Instead of writing (x > 1) and (x < 10), you can simply write 1 < x < 10. This makes code more readable and closer to mathematical notation.",
  "examples": [
    "# Chained comparisons",
    "x = 5",
    "",
    "# Mathematical style (Python)",
    "if 1 < x < 10:",
    "    print('x is between 1 and 10')",
    "",
    "# Traditional style (other languages)",
    "if x > 1 and x < 10:",
    "    print('x is between 1 and 10')",
    "",
    "# More complex chains",
    "a, b, c = 1, 5, 10",
    "if a < b < c:",
    "    print('Values are in ascending order')",
    "",
    "# Works with any comparison operators",
    "if 0 <= score <= 100:",
    "    print('Valid score')"
