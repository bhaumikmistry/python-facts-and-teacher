## Features

- **Automatic Fun Facts**: Shows a random Python fun fact whenever you open or create a `.py` file
- **Interactive Learning**: Click "Show More" to see detailed explanations, code examples, and helpful links
- **Rich Webview**: Beautiful, themed webview with syntax-highlighted code examples
- **Smart Rotation**: Tracks shown facts to avoid repetition in the same session
- **Manual Trigger**: Use the command palette to show facts anytime

## How It Works

1. **Open any Python file** - A notification will appear with a fun fact
2. **Create a new Python file** - Get a fact to inspire your coding session
3. **Click "Show More"** - Opens a detailed webview with:
   - Full explanation of the concept
   - Code examples you can try
   - Links to official documentation and tutorials
4. **Click "Dismiss"** - Simply close the notification

## üìñ Sample Facts Include

### üìö Fact Categories

**Language Origins & History:**

- Python started as a Christmas holiday project in 1989
- Named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, not the snake
- Python is older than Java (1991 vs 1995)
- Python overtook French in primary school popularity

**Language Features:**

- The Zen of Python and its 19 guiding principles
- Duck typing: "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck..."
- List comprehensions and their performance benefits
- The powerful slice operator for elegant data manipulation
- F-strings: the fastest way to format strings
- Walrus operator (:=) for assignment expressions
- Match statements for structural pattern matching

**Advanced Concepts:**

- Everything is an object in Python
- The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its implications
- Generators for memory-efficient iteration
- Decorators for extending function behavior
- Context managers and the 'with' statement
- Async/await for concurrent programming

**Hidden Gems & Easter Eggs:**

- Underscore (\_) remembers the last expression result
- Python can define infinity with float('inf')
- Hidden easter eggs like `import antigravity` and `import __hello__`
- The braces joke: `from __future__ import braces` (SyntaxError: not a chance)
- Hash of infinity returns 314159 (10^5 √ó œÄ)
- Unicode variable names support (üêç = 'Python' works!)
- The this.py module paradox (ugly code teaching beauty)
- FLUFL diamond operator (<>) from April Fools' PEP 401
- Chained comparisons like `1 < x < 10`
- Else clauses with loops
- Multiple implementations: CPython, Jython, PyPy

**Modern Python:**

- Dataclasses for simplified class creation
- Pathlib for modern path handling
- Type hints for better code documentation
- Collections module for specialized data types
- Itertools for powerful iterator operations
