# Contributing to Python Facts and Teacher

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Python Facts and Teacher VS Code extension! This guide will help you add new Python facts to our collection.

## üéØ What Makes a Good Python Fact?

Before adding a new fact, consider these criteria:

### ‚úÖ Good Facts Should Be:

- **Educational**: Teaches something useful about Python
- **Interesting**: Surprising, fun, or lesser-known information
- **Accurate**: Factually correct and up-to-date
- **Practical**: Includes working code examples when relevant
- **Well-sourced**: Links to official documentation or reliable sources

### üìö Fact Categories We Love:

- Language features and syntax
- Historical information and trivia
- Performance tips and best practices
- Hidden gems and easter eggs
- Standard library highlights
- Python ecosystem insights
- Common misconceptions clarified

## üìù How to Add a New Fact

### Step 1: Create a New JSON File

1. Navigate to the `src/facts/` directory
2. Create a new file with a descriptive name: `your-fact-name.json`
3. Use kebab-case for the filename (e.g., `list-comprehensions.json`)

### Step 2: Follow the JSON Structure

```json
{
  "id": "unique-fact-id",
  "title": "Your Fact Title",
  "shortDescription": "Brief one-line description for the notification popup",
  "detailedDescription": "Detailed explanation of the concept, feature, or trivia. This should be informative and engaging, providing context and background information.",
  "examples": [
    "# Code example 1",
    "print('Hello, Python!')",
    "",
    "# Code example 2 with explanation",
    "result = [x**2 for x in range(5)]",
    "print(result)  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]",
    "",
    "# You can include multiple examples",
    "# Comments help explain what's happening"
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "title": "Official Python Documentation",
      "url": "https://docs.python.org/3/..."
    },
    {
      "title": "Related PEP or Article",
      "url": "https://peps.python.org/pep-..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Field Guidelines

#### `id` (required)

- **Format**: kebab-case string
- **Uniqueness**: Must be unique across all facts
- **Example**: `"walrus-operator"`, `"zen-of-python"`

#### `title` (required)

- **Length**: Keep it concise (under 50 characters)
- **Style**: Title case, descriptive
- **Example**: `"The Walrus Operator (:=)"`

#### `shortDescription` (required)

- **Length**: One sentence, under 100 characters
- **Purpose**: Shown in the VS Code notification popup
- **Style**: Engaging and intriguing
- **Example**: `"Python 3.8 introduced the walrus operator (:=) for assignment expressions!"`

#### `detailedDescription` (required)

- **Length**: 2-4 sentences, comprehensive explanation
- **Content**: Background, context, why it matters
- **Style**: Educational but accessible
- **Example**: Explain the feature, its history, use cases, and significance

#### `examples` (optional but recommended)

- **Format**: Array of strings, each representing a line of code
- **Content**: Working Python code that demonstrates the concept
- **Comments**: Use `#` comments to explain what's happening
- **Best Practices**:
  - Include multiple examples showing different aspects
  - Add output comments where helpful: `# Output: [1, 2, 3]`
  - Use empty strings `""` for blank lines
  - Keep examples concise but complete

#### `links` (optional but recommended)

- **Minimum**: At least one link to official documentation
- **Quality**: Prefer official Python docs, PEPs, or reputable sources
- **Variety**: Mix of official docs, tutorials, and related articles

## üîç Example: Complete Fact File

Here's a complete example (`src/facts/set-comprehensions.json`):

```json
{
  "id": "set-comprehensions",
  "title": "Set Comprehensions: Unique Collections",
  "shortDescription": "Python supports set comprehensions for creating unique collections efficiently!",
  "detailedDescription": "Set comprehensions work like list comprehensions but create sets instead of lists, automatically removing duplicates. They use curly braces {} and are more memory-efficient than converting lists to sets. This feature was introduced in Python 2.7 and 3.1.",
  "examples": [
    "# Basic set comprehension",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]",
    "unique_squares = {x**2 for x in numbers}",
    "print(unique_squares)  # {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}",
    "",
    "# With condition",
    "even_squares = {x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}",
    "print(even_squares)  # {0, 4, 16, 36, 64}",
    "",
    "# More efficient than list -> set conversion",
    "# Slow: set([x**2 for x in numbers])",
    "# Fast: {x**2 for x in numbers}"
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "title": "Python Set Comprehensions",
      "url": "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets"
    },
    {
      "title": "PEP 274 - Dict Comprehensions",
      "url": "https://peps.python.org/pep-0274/"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üß™ Testing Your Fact

### Before Submitting:

1. **Validate JSON**: Ensure your JSON is properly formatted
2. **Test Examples**: Run all code examples to verify they work
3. **Check Links**: Verify all URLs are accessible and relevant
4. **Proofread**: Check spelling, grammar, and technical accuracy

### JSON Validation:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd python-facts-and-teacher

# Compile to check for JSON errors
npm run compile
```

If there are JSON syntax errors, the compilation will fail with helpful error messages.
